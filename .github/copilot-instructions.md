# AgentCore AI Assistant Instructions

This document provides key context for AI coding assistants working in the AgentCore repository.

## Project Overview

AgentCore is a new project that appears to be in its initial setup phase. The repository currently has minimal content and is configured with Node.js/.yarn related ignores, suggesting it will likely be a JavaScript/TypeScript-based project.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently empty except for configuration files. As the project develops, this section will document key directories and their purposes.

## Development Workflow

### Setup
*To be documented as development workflows are established*

### Building
*To be documented as build processes are defined*

### Testing
*To be documented as testing approaches are implemented*

## Key Patterns and Conventions

As the project develops, this section will document:
- Architectural patterns and design decisions
- Code organization conventions
- Naming conventions
- Error handling approaches
- Testing patterns
- Integration patterns with external systems

## External Dependencies

The `.gitignore` suggests the project may use:
- Node.js ecosystem tools
- Yarn package manager (v3)
- Various JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks (configurations present for Next.js, Vite, Svelte, etc.)

Specific versions and requirements will be documented as they are established.

## Getting Help

*To be documented: Where to find additional documentation, who to contact for questions, etc.*
